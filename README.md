# How to use requirements.txt

To install the dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file in Python 3, you can use the `pip` package manager. Here are the steps to do so:

1. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your `requirements.txt` file is located.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/directory
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command tells `pip3` to install the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

3. **Verify Installation**: After the installation process completes, you can verify that the dependencies were installed correctly by running:

   ```bash
   pip3 list
   ```

   This command will display a list of installed packages along with their versions.

By following these steps, you can easily install the dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file for your Python 3 project.
